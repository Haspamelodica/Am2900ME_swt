See https://github.com/MaisiKoleni/Am2900ME

Full credit for Am2900ME goes to MaisiKoleni!

This repo differs from https://github.com/MaisiKoleni/Am2900ME in the following ways:
1. The packages net.maisikoleni.am2900me.ui and some classes in net.maisikoleni.am2900me.util are replaced by new classes in net.haspamelodica.am2900me.swtgui and net.haspamelodica.swt.helper.
2. No dependency on JavaFX, instead dependency on SWT.
3. MaisiKoleni's classes are "downgraded" to Java 8
4. No maven nature; dependencies (currently only SWT) are resolved by hard-coded Eclipse-Builder "Referenced Libraries"...
5. "Âµ" in names is replaced by "mu"
